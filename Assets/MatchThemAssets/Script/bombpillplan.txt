on horizontal and vertical stack check [*]
make true the bomb or pill property of "thiscell" and protect [*]

dont make pill if bomb is made

Clear horizontal and vertical matches seperately []

Sometimes, bombs are not being deleted []

Explode the bomb!! []

Explode the pill!! []

convert to bomb or pill only if virus was animating in previous frame
This will be done by observing the previous frame's animation data, locating the relevant virus by rounding it's coordinates and assigning this virus with the special property
also if horizontal pill or bomb creation, if there are any matches to the right that weren't animating, the rightmost virus is converted

There are empty objects that are left over...seems like a bug.
We need to modify doemptydown to only animate the tiles that need to be animated
